This is a Flutter project following Clean Architecture and MVVM. Use Riverpod for state management, Navigator 2.0 for routing, and ensure all code is modular and testable. Prioritize Windows desktop support and offline-first features. Replicate the UI/UX of the original React log-analyzer app as closely as possible.
